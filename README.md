Fire Image Detection

A deep learning image classification system that detects the presence of forest fires in images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This TensorFlow-based model enables rapid identification of fire outbreaks in forest surveillance imagery for early warning and prevention.

Key Features:

Binary classification model distinguishing between fire and no-fire scenarios
Custom CNN architecture with 4 convolutional layers optimized for fire detection
Training, validation, and testing workflows for reliable model development
Interactive prediction function for testing on new images
Performance visualization with accuracy and loss metrics

Technologies:

TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning
OpenCV for image processing
Google Colab integration for cloud-based training
Matplotlib for result visualization

Ideal for environmental monitoring systems, forestry departments, and disaster prevention agencies seeking automated wildfire detection capabilities from visual surveillance data.
